# Example for model finetuning

This folder contains example scripts that show how to finetune a SAM model on your own data and how the finetuned model can then be used:

- `finetune_psfhs.py`: Shows how to finetune the model on new data.
- `annotator_with_finetuned_model.py`: Use the finetuned model in the 2d annotator.
