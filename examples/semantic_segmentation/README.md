# Example for training semantic segmentation

This folder contains example scripts that show how to train a SAM model on your own data:

- `train_semantic_segmentation_2d.py`: Shows how to train a semantic segmentation model on 2d data.
- `train_semantic_segmentation_3d.py`: Shows how to train a semantic segmentation model on 3d data.

> NOTE: Scripts to evaluate trained semantic segmentation models coming soon!
