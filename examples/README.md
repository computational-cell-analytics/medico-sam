# Examples

Examples of using `medico_sam` with the `micro_sam` annotation tools:
- `annotator_2d.py`: run the interactive 2d annotation tool.
- `annotator_3d.py`: run the interactive 3d annotation tool.
- `image_series_annotator.py`: run the annotation tool for a series of images.

The folder `finetuning` contains example scripts that show how a Segment Anything model can be fine-tuned on custom data with the `micro_sam.train` library, and how the finetuned models can then be used within the annotation tools.

The folder `semantic_segmentation` contains example scripts that show how a Segment Anything model can be fine-tuned on custom data with the `micro_sam` library for semantic segmentation.
