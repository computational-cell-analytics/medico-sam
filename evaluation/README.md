# Segment Anything Evaluation

Scripts for evaluating Segment Anything (and other medical variants), and MedicoSAM models.

> NOTE: The top-level scripts are used for different evaluations (for interactive segmentation and semantic segmentation (both in 2d and 3d)).

The directory structure is for:
- `sam1`: Scripts for running Segment Anything for 3d interactive segmentation.
- `sam2`: Scripts for running Segment Anything 2 for both 2d and 3d interactive segmentation.
    - > NOTE: The support for `sam2` depends on an ongoing project. We will make a release for the package soon. Stay tuned!
