"""Sample medical imaging data.

You can change the download location for the sample data and model weights
by setting the environment variable: MEDICOSAM_CACHEDIR

By default sample data is downloaded to a folder named 'medico_sam/sample_data'.
inside your default cache directory, eg:
    * Mac: ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
    * Unix: ~/.cache/<AppName> or the value of the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable, if defined.
    * Windows: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache
